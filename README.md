# Project Title: Employee Attrition Prediction Model

Description: This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition in an organization. By analyzing key employee features such as performance rating, education level, city, and state, the model aims to provide insights into which employees are most likely to leave the company.

The goal of this project is to help organizations reduce recruitment costs and increase productivity by focusing retention efforts on valuable employees. The model is built using Python and XGBoost, addressing class imbalance through SMOTE and undersampling methods.

**Key Features:**

- Employee attrition prediction using XGBoost
- Feature importance analysis (e.g., City, State, Performance Rating)
- Class imbalance handling using SMOTE and undersampling
- Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Visual representation of feature importance and model performance

**Technologies:**

- Python
- XGBoost
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
